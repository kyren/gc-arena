   = help: the trait `Send` is not implemented for `Rc<i32>`
   = note: required for `Gc<'_, Rc<i32>>` to implement `Send`
note: required because it appears within the type `TestStruct<'_>`

   = note: required for the cast from `TestStruct<'_>` to the object type `dyn TestTrait<'_> + Send`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `unsize` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
