/// them to come from, and that they're all either reachable from root or have been allocated during
/// the current `mutate` call. When not inside the `mutate` callback, the arena knows that all `Gc`
/// pointers must be either reachable from root or they are unreachable and safe to collect. In
/// this way, incremental garbage collection can be achieved (assuming "sufficiently small" calls
/// to `mutate`) that is both extremely safe and zero overhead vs what you would write in C with raw
