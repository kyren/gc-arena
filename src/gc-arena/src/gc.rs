// to `Gc` types that may be any possible 'gc lifetime. This must work for the soundness of the
// garbage collector generally, it is what prevents `Gc` pointers from escaping the arena, so we
// know that it is okay to mark `Gc<'static, T>` as Send, because we know that to be Send it must
// be "at rest", contained in the root object of an Arena being interacted with from the outside.
// Arena and Gc are both !Sync, and all Context types are !Sync and !Send, so this locks access
// to a GC context and all associated Gc pointers to a single thread for the duration of a call
